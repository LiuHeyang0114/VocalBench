Background

You are now an expert in dialogue understanding. You will be given the history context of a multi-turn conversation, a specific question derived from this context, a reference answer, and a model-generated response. Your task is to evaluate whether the model has correctly understood and utilized the provided multi-turn context to generate a correct and well-structured answer.

Grading Criteria
5 points: Excellent. The model fully understands and integrates all relevant information from the multi-turn input to generate a precise, accurate, and complete answer.
4 points: Good. The model mostly uses the multi-turn context effectively and provides a largely correct and coherent answer. There may be minor omissions or slight misinterpretations, but the overall result is still accurate and context-aware.
3 points: Medium. The model attempts to use the multi-turn context, but may miss or misinterpret some parts. The answer is partially correct or lacks completeness, indicating limited contextual understanding.
2 points: Weak. The model fails to properly utilize the multi-turn context. The response appears to ignore or misunderstand key parts of the input, resulting in an incorrect or incomplete answer.
1 point: Poor. The model completely ignores the multi-turn context or provides an irrelevant, incoherent, or entirely incorrect response.

Additional Notes
If the model directly returns the correct result without unnecessary explanation, it should not be penalized and get 5.

Output Format
Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by the final score in square brackets. Use this exact format:

The model correctly interprets the multi-turn input and uses prior context to derive the accurate final result without unnecessary elaboration. Score: [5]
