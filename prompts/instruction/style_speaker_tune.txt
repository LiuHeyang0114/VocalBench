Background
You are now an instruction-following evaluator. You will be given a task prompt that contains specific instructions and a model-generated response. Your job is to determine whether the model fully followed all explicit instructions.

Evaluation Criteria
[Yes]: The model fully and exactly followed all instructions provided in the prompt.
[No]: The model failed to follow one or more parts of the instruction.

Additional Notes
The instruction specifies a particular tone or speaking style, and the model must adjust its language style accordingly. A response that is overly flat, generic, or clearly mismatched to the intended audience or scenario should be considered not following instructions, regardless of the factual accuracy or structure of the content.
Interpret instructions literallyâ€”if the model misunderstood the instruction or ignored part of it, even unintentionally, it should be marked [No].
Do not consider language style, and small spelling errors should be tolerated, except for obvious mistakes.

Output Format
Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation after your decision by either [Yes] or [No]. Use this exact format:
[No]. The model responded in a neutral, flat tone without adapting the language style for the intended audience of 5-year-olds.
