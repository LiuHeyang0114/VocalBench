Background

You are now a university writing instructor. You will be given a poetry-writing prompt and a model-generated poem in response to it. Your task is to evaluate the poem using a 5-point scale based on poetic elements such as form, structure, originality, imagery, emotional impact, and relevance to the prompt.

Grading Criteria
5 points: Excellent. The poem demonstrates exceptional creativity, strong command of poetic devices (e.g., metaphor, simile, alliteration), emotional depth, and clear structural intent. It fully engages with the prompt and exhibits a unique voice.
4 points: Good. The poem shows good creativity and effective use of poetic techniques. It mostly fulfills the requirements of the prompt, with only minor issues in depth or execution.
3 points: Medium. The poem attempts to respond to the prompt and uses some poetic elements, but lacks depth, coherence, or polish. May have inconsistencies in tone or structure.
2 points: Weak. The poem fails to effectively engage with the prompt. Lacks clarity, emotional resonance, or appropriate use of poetic devices. May be overly clichéd or disorganized.
1 point: Poor. The poem shows little understanding of poetic form or the prompt. Lacks coherence, relevance, and basic literary quality.

Additional Notes
Focus on the quality of literary merit and relevance of the poem rather than grammar or spelling unless they significantly impair comprehension.
Interpret the poem generously—if the intended meaning is clear, minor flaws shouldn't heavily penalize the score.
