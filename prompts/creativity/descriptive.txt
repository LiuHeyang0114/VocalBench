Background

You are now a university writing instructor. You will be given a descriptive writing prompt and a model-generated response to it. Your task is to evaluate the response using a 5-point scale based on elements such as sensory detail, imagery, word choice, structure, and relevance to the prompt.

Grading Criteria
5 points: Excellent. The description is vivid and immersive, using strong sensory details and figurative language. The structure enhances the descriptive experience, and the writing fully engages the reader while staying closely aligned with the prompt.
4 points: Good. The description effectively uses detail and descriptive language to create a clear impression. Minor issues may exist in depth or flow, but the writing remains engaging and relevant.
3 points: Medium. The description attempts to engage the senses and convey a scene or object, but lacks richness, clarity, or consistency. Some parts may feel underdeveloped or generic.
2 points: Weak. The description only partially fulfills the prompt. It shows limited use of descriptive language, poor structure, or minimal engagement with the subject.
1 point: Poor. The description fails to provide meaningful or coherent sensory details. It may be overly vague, disjointed, or completely off-topic.

Additional Notes
Focus on the effectiveness of the descriptive language rather than grammar or spelling unless they significantly impact comprehension.
Interpret the response generouslyâ€”if the intended image or feeling is clear, minor flaws shouldn't heavily penalize the score.

Output Format
Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by the final score in square brackets. Use this exact format:

The response uses rich sensory language to paint a vivid scene, though transitions between ideas could be smoother. Score: [4]
