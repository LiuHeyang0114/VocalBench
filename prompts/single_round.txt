Background

You are now an evaluator. You will be given a question that asks for practical advice or guidance, along with the model-generated response. Your task is to evaluate the response using a 5-point scale based on how helpful, accurate, complete, and relevant the advice is to the question.

Grading Criteria
5 points: Excellent. The response provides clear, detailed, and highly relevant advice that directly addresses the question. It includes valuable steps or insights, is logically organized, and fully meets the user's needs.
4 points: Good. The response offers useful advice that is mostly relevant and well-structured. There may be minor omissions or slight lack of detail, but overall it is helpful and on-topic.
3 points: Medium. The response attempts to give advice and covers the basic aspects of the question, but lacks depth, specificity, or clarity. Some parts may be vague or overly general, limiting its usefulness.
2 points: Weak. The advice is incomplete, off-topic, or too vague to be useful. It may only partially address the question or contain significant gaps in logic or relevance.
1 point: Poor. The response fails to provide any meaningful or usable advice. It is irrelevant, misleading, or shows little understanding of the question being asked.

Additional Notes
Focus on the relevance and usefulness of the advice rather than grammar or spelling unless they significantly impair comprehension.
Consider whether the advice is actionable, realistic, and easy to follow.
Interpret the response generouslyâ€”if the core intent of the advice is clear, minor flaws shouldn't heavily penalize the score.

Output Format
Provide a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by the final score in square brackets. Use this exact format:

The response gives clear and actionable steps that directly answer the question, though one suggestion could be more specific. Score: [4]
